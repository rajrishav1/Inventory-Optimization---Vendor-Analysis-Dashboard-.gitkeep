### Description:
Inventory Optimization: Strategic Vendor Analysis Dashboard


### Project Overview

This repository hosts a vital analytical tool focused on Inventory Optimization and Vendor Performance Management within a supply chain context. The core output is a robust, interactive dashboard built using Tableau.

The primary objective is to transform raw purchasing and consumption data into actionable intelligence, enabling procurement teams to:

- Identify high-cost inventory drivers.
- Optimize stocking levels based on consumption.
- Evaluate vendor value based on both spend and revenue generation.

### Key Dashboard Insights
The dashboard is structured to answer critical business questions and is summarized in the accompanying static PDF report.




### 1. Cost and Volume Drivers
    These metrics highlight where the inventory budget is being allocated:
    - Top Implant Cost: Identifies the specific products responsible for the highest overall cost.
    - Top Vendors by Implant Quantity: Shows the suppliers providing the largest volume of physical implants.
    - Most Consumed Implants: Tracks high-usage items by quantity to ensure accurate stock replenishment planning.





### 2. Strategic Vendor Evaluation
    These insights help stakeholders evaluate the long-term strategic value of vendor relationships:
    - Top Revenue Generating Vendors: Pinpoints the vendors associated with the highest revenue, indicating key strategic partners.
    - Vendor Distribution: Provides a visual or categorical breakdown of vendor relationships across different locations or groups.
